			    <p>As previously mentioned, most of the work showcased here are published works throughout my tenureship. Analyses that are shown below are already 'out there' and can be accessed online in publishers site (e.g. Elseiver).</p>

			    <h5 class="mt-5">What drives wine complexity?</h5>
			    <p>The aim this study was to look at how wine complexity varying with type and age may perceived differently between novices and expert tasters. The method that was used here was Temporal Check All That Apply which means that participants were asked to provide their temporal perception of the wine. We also looked on what characteristics of the wine drives complexity. The results of this study is published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329321000574" target="_blank"> Food Quality and Preference in 2021. </a> </p>

Thicker lines denote portions of an attribute curve which are significantly different from the same attribute in all other pooled products, where the reference line for that portion is displayed via a dashed line (using Fisher’s exact test at 5% significance level). Time is expressed in seconds, with a vertical black line at t = 30 indicating the point at which participants were asked to swallow.</figcaption>

			    <figcaption class="mt-2 text-center image-caption">Correspondence Analysis trajectories of TCATA evaluation for experts (A and C) and novices (B and D). Each trajectory indicates the flavour evolution over time for one wine. Three age points (3, 10, and 20 years) are shown in each graph for the same grape variety: Malvasia (A and B) and Tinta Negra (C and D). Attributes are represented by red triangles. Time markers (black circles) are positioned along each trajectory at 15 s intervals to show progression of evaluation time, with a X at the 30 s mark indicating when the participants were instructed to swallow the wine.</figcaption>

Blue vectors (supplementary variables) show wine complexity ratings and meta-factors (# attributes, length, total intensity, total change over time). Product attributes at different points in time are represented by red text, with squares (■) indicating attribute citation rates at the beginning (1–15 s), diamonds (♦) indicating middle (16–30 s) and triangles (▲) indicating end (31–120 s) of the tasting experience.
