			    <h5 class="mt-5">What drives wine complexity?</h5>
			    <p>The aim this study was to look at how wine complexity varying with type and age may perceived differently between novices and expert tasters. The method that was used here was Temporal Check All That Apply which means that participants were asked to provide their temporal perception of the wine. We also looked on what characteristics of the wine drives complexity.

			    <p>One of the aim of this study was to understand the relationship free amino acids and fatty acids with TBARS. In a nutshell, the higher the TBARS value, the more oxidation species and flavours would appear in the products.

F1 (33.14%) and F2 (22.18%) explained a total of 55.32% of the variance. Not only flat cuts with high pressure were high with TBARS value, additional samples like loin cuts at 400 and 600MPas were also found to be high in TBARS value. We also can see that TBARS measures doesn't necessary correlate with free amino acid and fatty acid measures.

The plots show: (a) centroid variables of each environment which are correlated with the two factors on the factor axes, (b) variables of flavour and emotion attributes which are correlated with the two factors on the factor axes. To aid visualisation, positive emotions are labelled in green while negative emotions are labelled in black, and sensory attributes are labelled in blue.
