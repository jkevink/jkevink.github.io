			    <p>Hey guys, I'm Kevin Kantono - a scientist who is fascinated with understanding human perception. My background comes from Food Science, where I have received my undergraduate in Food Science, but ended up pursuing Sensory & Consumer Science for my postgraduate and my PhD. My PhD work was the perfect blend of crossmodal sensory integration, psychoacoustics, and applied psychometrics which was to look at the influence of music towards food perception (which was gelato btw!). I completed all my education in Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand and currently resides in Denmark where I am employed as a Sensory Scientist for Arla Foods.</p>

			    <h5 class="mt-5">About The Blog</h5>
			    <p>The overall aim for this blog is to educate and showcase multiple statistical techniques that I have applied overtime from the area of sensory, consumer, and psychology or fancily named sensometrics and psychometrics. I am passionate in understanding data and of course with this blog I aim to make new stats simple, approachable, and less daunting for new users in the field.</p>
			    <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills and Experiences</h5>
			    <p>I was lucky enough to be offered a position as a Research and Teaching Assistant throughout my tenure in AUT. I then worked as a Product Development Technologist in Sanford Ltd immediately after my PhD and moved to Denmark to become a Sensory Scientist where I reside now. My experience with data is quite diverse where I have handled multidisplinary datasets particularly from Food Chemistry such as flavour volatiles measurements, and up to Biomedical Sciences looking at cancer line activities. Most of the analyses that will be included in this page has been peer reviewed and published, the full list of publication can be found on my Google Scholar page. </p>
			    <h5 class="mt-5">Side Projects</h5>
			    <p>Well this blog is definitely a side project, I also enjoy supervising students and now sits as a Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Food Science in AUT. I'm currently a Guest Editor for some Special Issues and also a Reviewer Board Member for the MDPI's journal Nutrients.</p>
