			    <h5 class="mt-5">Understanding the relationship between free amino acids, fatty acids, and TBARS value </h5>
			    <p>One of the aim of this study was to understand the relationship free amino acids and fatty acids with TBARS. In a nutshell, the higher the TBARS value, the more oxidation species and flavours would appear in the products. Numerous factors were explored here from different lamb cuts and High Pressure Processing (HPP) processing parameters. A RM-ANOVA is applied here as chemical measures are done in triplicates and Fisher LSD was then applied. Multiple PCAs (not shown here) was also made but to further understand the overall relationship a MFA was then conducted. The results of this study is published in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/9/10/1444/htm" target="_blank"> Foods in 2020. </a> </p>

			    <figcaption class="mt-2 text-center image-caption">A bar chart visualisation is applied here for the lipid oxidation marker (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in different lamb cuts and high-pressure processing samples. (A) different cuts and (B) different processing means of TBARS value with different cut samples (B-a–B-h) differ significantly using Fisher’s least significant difference (p < 0.05).</figcaption>

			    <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills and Experiences</h5>
			    <p>I was lucky enough to be offered a position as a Research and Teaching Assistant throughout my tenure in AUT. I then worked as a Product Development Technologist in Sanford Ltd immediately after my PhD and moved to Denmark to become a Sensory Scientist where I reside now. My experience with data is quite diverse where I have handled multidisplinary datasets particularly from Food Chemistry such as flavour volatiles measurements, and up to Biomedical Sciences looking at cancer line activities. Most of the analyses that will be included in this page has been peer reviewed and published, the full list of publication can be found on my Google Scholar page. </p>
			    <h5 class="mt-5">Side Projects</h5>
			    <p>Well this blog is definitely a side project, I also enjoy supervising students and now sits as a Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Food Science in AUT. I'm currently a Guest Editor for some Special Issues and also a Reviewer Board Member for the MDPI's journal Nutrients.</p>
